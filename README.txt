CNN Emotion Predictor

This repository is a practice implementation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning for image classification.

I followed a tutorial to refresh and deepen my understanding of CNN architecture. I built a model that takes an image of a person and predicts whether they are sad or happy.

This project was implemented using Keras/TensorFlow.
